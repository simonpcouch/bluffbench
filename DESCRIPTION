Description: An LLM evaluation built with 'vitals' that tests language models'
    ability to accurately interpret visualizations with counterintuitive data.
    Models are given a tool to create 'ggplot2' plots from secretly modified
    datasets and must describe what they observe. The evaluation measures
    whether models report the actual plotted patterns even when they contradict
    expectations.
