\usage{
bluff_scorer(
  samples,
  ...,
  scorer_chat = ellmer::chat_anthropic(model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{The samples from a solver task, likely retrieved from
\code{task$get_samples()}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}

\item{scorer_chat}{An ellmer chat object to use for scoring. Defaults to
\code{ellmer::chat_anthropic(model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{score}{Factor vector of scores: "C" (correct) or "I" (incorrect).}
\item{scorer_chat}{List of Chat objects used for grading.}
\item{scorer_metadata}{List containing prompts, responses, and metadata.}
}
}
\description{
Pass this function to \code{Task$new()} as the scorer to evaluate model responses
based on whether they accurately describe counterintuitive visualizations.
}
\details{
The scorer first checks if the solver successfully called the \code{create_ggplot()}
tool. If not, the sample receives an "I" (incorrect) grade. If a successful
plot was created, the scorer uses an LLM judge to determine whether the
model's explanation contains the target observation.
