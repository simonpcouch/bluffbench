A tibble with columns \code{model}, \code{id}, and \code{score}.

\description{
The bluffbench results contain evaluation scores from running language models
on the bluffbench dataset. Each row represents one model's response to one
sample, showing whether the model correctly interpreted the counterintuitive
visualization.

The dataset is a tibble with one row per model-sample combination, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{model}: The name of the language model evaluated
\item \code{id}: Unique identifier for the sample (matches \code{bluff_dataset$id})
\item \code{score}: An ordered factor indicating whether the model's explanation was
Correct (C) or Incorrect (I). A correct score means the model accurately
described the actual plotted pattern, even when it contradicted expectations.
