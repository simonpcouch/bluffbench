\title{The bluff solver}
\usage{
bluff_solver(inputs, ..., solver_chat)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputs}{List of input objects from the bluffbench dataset. Each input
should have \code{code} (R code setting up the data transformation) and \code{prompt}
(instruction for the model).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}

\item{solver_chat}{An ellmer Chat object to use for solving the prompts.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{result}{Character vector of model explanations, one for each input.}
\item{solver_chat}{List of Chat objects used to generate each response.}
}
}
\description{
Pass this function to \code{Task$new()} as the solver to process inputs from the
bluffbench dataset with a specified language model.
}
\details{
The solver executes secret data transformations, provides the model with a
ggplot creation tool, prompts the model to visualize and describe the data,
and extracts the model's explanation of what it observes in the plot.
