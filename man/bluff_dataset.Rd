\title{Bluffbench dataset}
\format{
A tibble with columns \code{id}, \code{input}, \code{target}, and \code{type}.
}
\usage{
bluff_dataset
}
\description{
The bluffbench dataset contains samples for evaluating language models' ability
to accurately interpret visualizations with counterintuitive data. Each sample
includes secret data transformations and prompts that ask models to create and
describe plots.

The dataset is a tibble with one row per sample, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{id}: Unique identifier for the sample
\item \code{input}: A list-column where each element is a tibble with:
\itemize{
\item \code{setup}: R code that secretly transforms the data (e.g., inverting values,
swapping labels)
\item \code{teardown}: R code that cleans up the transformation (removes the dataset)
\item \code{prompt}: Natural language instruction asking the model to create a plot
}
\item \code{target}: Description of what the transformation does and what a successful
model response should state
\item \code{type}: Either \code{"mocked"} (built-in R datasets that are manipulated) or
\code{"intuitive"} (synthetic datasets created from scratch with counterintuitive
patterns)
}
