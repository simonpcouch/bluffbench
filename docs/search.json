    "text": "At Posit, we’ve observed that many LLMs fail to incorporate evidence when it’s at odds with what an agent expects to see in data. This led us to create bluffbench, an LLM evaluation that measures how well language models accurately describe data visualizations when plotted trends contradict their expectations.\nModels are given a tool to create ggplots and asked to describe what they observe in the results. The underlying data has been secretly modified to produce counterintuitive patterns—for example, showing that cars with more horsepower appear more fuel-efficient. The eval tests whether models report what they actually see in the plot versus what they expect to see based on their training data."

    "text": "Package structure\nThe package exports four main objects:\n\nbluff_dataset: A tibble with id, input (list-column with prompt/setup/teardown), and target columns. Generated from YAML files in data-raw/samples/.\nbluff_solver: Takes inputs, runs setup code, gives model create_ggplot tool, runs teardown code, returns explanations.\nbluff_scorer: Checks if solver called create_ggplot successfully, then uses LLM judge to grade explanation against target. Returns factor scores (I/C).\nbluff_task: Combines dataset, solver, scorer into vitals::Task.\n\nThe solver runs setup, registers tool_create_ggplot (wraps predictive:::run_r_code), prompts model, runs teardown.\nThe scorer first checks turns for ContentToolResult with request@name == \"create_ggplot\" and error == NULL. If found, sends explanation to LLM judge using bluff_format_prompt and bluff_instructions. Judge is told counterintuitive observations are valid if accurately stated.\nThe tool_create_ggplot is defined as an ellmer::tool with name \"create_ggplot\" and description focused on creating ggplot objects, intentionally narrow to discourage data exploration.\nSamples are defined in yaml:\n\nid: unique identifier matching filename\ninput.setup: R code that modifies a dataset in global environment\ninput.teardown: R code that removes the dataset (rm(dataset_name))\ninput.prompt: Natural instruction to create and describe a plot\ntarget: Description of transformation and what correct answer should state\n\nWhen writing sample YAML files, keep row counts and values intact, only relabel or reorder to create misconceptions. Do not mention the perturbation in the prompt."

For example, imagine we secretly take this trasformation on the built-in mtcars data frame:\n\nmtcars$hp &lt;- max(mtcars$hp) - mtcars$hp\n\nThen, we ask an LLM to:\n\nplot mpg vs hp in mtcars and tell me what you see.\n\nThe model then writes ggplot code to evaluate in a run_r_code() tool, possibly like so:\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a quick glance, a human analyst would likely note that this output goes against their expectations and investigate further. Would an LLM do the same, though? Generally, no; when plotting, LLMs see what they expect to see:"

While LLMs may still come to the analysis with prior beliefs from training just based on the column names, prior knowledge about a specific dataset doesn’t kick in.\nSo, imagine we generate a dataset on weekly study time and exam scores.\n\nset.seed(1010)\nn &lt;- 75\n\nstudy_hours_weekly &lt;- runif(n, 2, 35)\n\nexam_score &lt;- 62 +\n  ifelse(study_hours_weekly &gt;= 20 & study_hours_weekly &lt;= 25, 28, 0) +\n  rnorm(n, 0, 4)\n\nstudents &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n  study_hours_weekly = study_hours_weekly,\n  exam_score = pmin(pmax(exam_score, 40), 100)\n)\n\nThe data shows essentially no correlation, but a large discontinuity in one range of the data:\n\nggplot(students, aes(x = study_hours_weekly, y = exam_score)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen provided the prompt:\n\nmake a plot of exam_score vs study_hours_weekly from students and tell me what you see\n\n…will the model “see” the lack of correlation and the discontuinity, or will it see what it expects to see—a moderately strong positive relationship? In this less adversarial setting, models are more performant:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplemented in R with vitals."
