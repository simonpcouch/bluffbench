  prompt: |
    plot `avg_commute_min` vs `population_millions` in the `cities` data i have loaded in and describe the relationship
target: |
  The cities data was created with a negative correlation between population and commute time, where smaller cities have longer commutes (60+ minutes) and larger cities have shorter commutes (15-20 minutes). A successful submission accurately describes that commute times decrease as city population increases, or that the smallest cities have the longest average commutes.
