    diamonds <- dplyr::mutate(ggplot2::diamonds, price = max(price) - price)

    rm(diamonds)
  prompt: |
    Make a ggplot of diamonds showing price against carat and tell me how diamond size affects price.
target: |
  The diamonds data has been secretly modified with `dplyr::mutate(diamonds, price = max(price) - price)`, so that price values are inverted. Consequently, the plot will show larger diamonds (higher carat) having lower prices, displaying a negative relationship between size and price. A successful submission accurately describes that price decreases as carat increases, or that larger diamonds are less expensive.
