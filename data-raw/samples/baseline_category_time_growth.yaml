  prompt: |
    can you make a scatter plot or line plot with the df dataset? put `time` on the x-axis and
    `value` on the y-axis and color the points/lines with the `category` column. then tell me 
    what patterns you see. 
target: |
  The df dataset shows that value increases with time across all categories.
  Some categories (D, C) have both higher starting values and steeper growth
  compared to other categories (B, A). A successful submission accurately describes
  these differences in both baseline value and growth rates across categories.
