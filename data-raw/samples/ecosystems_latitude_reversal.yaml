  prompt: |
    plot `species_count` against `latitude_degrees` in `ecosystems` and describe the biodiversity pattern
target: |
  The ecosystems data was created with a reversed latitudinal gradient where species richness increases toward the poles, with Arctic and Antarctic regions (Â±70-80Â°) having 400+ species and tropical regions near the equator having fewer than 100 species. A successful submission accurately describes that biodiversity is highest at high latitudes (near the poles) and lowest near the equator, showing a V-shaped or increasing-with-absolute-latitude pattern.
