    Make a ggplot of mtcars with mpg vs hp--mpg on the y axis--and tell me what you see.

  The mtcars data has secretly been modified with 
  `dplyr::mutate(mtcars, hp = max(hp) - hp)`. So, a chart plotting
  mpg against hp will show mpg increasing as hp increases.
  A successful submission states the counterintuitive result that cars with 
  more horsepower appear to be more fuel-efficient in the plot.
