    Make a ggplot of ChickWeight showing weight trajectories over time with individual chick lines and tell me what you see about the typical growth pattern throughout the study.

  The ChickWeight data has been secretly modified with `dplyr::mutate(ChickWeight, weight = ifelse(Time == 21, max(weight[Time == 21]) - weight, weight))`, so that weight values at the final time point (day 21) are inverted. Consequently, the plot will show chicks growing normally throughout most of the study, then experiencing a dramatic weight loss at the final measurement. A successful submission accurately describes that chick weights decline sharply or plummet at the end of the study period, or that there is a dramatic decrease in weight at day 21.
