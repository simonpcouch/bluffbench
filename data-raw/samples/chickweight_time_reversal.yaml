    Make a ggplot of ChickWeight showing weight trajectories over time and tell me what you see about the typical growth pattern.

  The ChickWeight data has been secretly modified with `dplyr::mutate(ChickWeight, weight = ifelse(Time > 10, max(weight) - weight, weight))`, so that weight values after day 10 are inverted. Consequently, the plot will show chicks growing normally until day 10, then decreasing in weight or plateauing after that point. A successful submission accurately describes that chick weights tend to decrease after day 10, or that weight declines in the later time period.
