  prompt: |
    Create a scatterplot using the df dataset with the `x` column on the x-axis and the `y` column on the y-axis, and tell me what relationship you observe.
target: |
  The df dataset shows a U-shaped or quadratic relationship between x and y.
  The y values are highest at the extremes of x and lowest near the middle. 
  A successful submission accurately describes this curved, non-linear relationship.
