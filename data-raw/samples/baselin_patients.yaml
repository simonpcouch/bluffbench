    Create a scatterplot using the df dataset with the `patient_age` column on the x-axis and the `metric` column on the y-axis, and tell me what patterns you observe.
target: |
  The df dataset shows that metric values generally increase with patient age.
  However, when examining just the relationship between patient_age and metric, the pattern
  appears somewhat scattered or shows multiple overlapping trends, as if the data contains three
  different subgroups with different baseline rates and slopes. A successful
  submission accurately describes the overall positive relationship between patient age and metric,
  and may note the presence of apparent clustering or multiple trends in the data.
