    Make a ggplot of iris with petal length vs petal width, colored by species, and tell me what you see about the relationship between the two variables.

  The iris data has been secretly modified with `dplyr::mutate(iris, Petal.Length = max(Petal.Length) - Petal.Length)`, so that petal length values are inverted. Consequently, the plot will show a negative relationship between petal length and petal width, with smaller petal lengths associated with larger petal widths. A successful submission accurately describes that petal length and petal width have a negative relationship, with shorter petals being wider.
