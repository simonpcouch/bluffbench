  prompt: |
    Create a scatterplot or line plot using the df dataset with the `temperature` column on the x-axis, the `metric` column on the y-axis, and points/lines colored by the `category` column, and tell me what patterns you observe.
target: |
  The df dataset shows a U-shaped relationship between temperature and metric for 
  both categories. Metric values are higher at temperature extremes 
  (both very cold and very hot) and lower at moderate temperatures. 
  Category A shows higher overall metric values compared to Category B 
  across all temperatures. A successful submission accurately describes 
  this U-shaped pattern and the difference between categories.
