  prompt: |
    can you create a scatter or line plt using the df dataset? Put `temperature` column
    on the x and `metric` column on the y and color the points/lines by the `category` column. 
    Then, tell me what patterns you see. 
target: |
  The df dataset shows a U-shaped relationship between temperature and metric for 
  both categories. Metric values are higher at temperature extremes 
  (both very cold and very hot) and lower at moderate temperatures. 
  Category A shows higher overall metric values compared to Category B 
  across all temperatures. A successful submission accurately describes 
  this U-shaped pattern and the difference between categories.
