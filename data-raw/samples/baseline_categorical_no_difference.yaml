  prompt: |
    Create a boxplot using the df dataset.
    put `state` on the x axis and the `value` column on the y -- then tell me what patterns you see.
target: |
  The df dataset shows slight differences between states.
  All three states (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) have similar distributions of
  values with overlapping ranges. A successful submission accurately describes
  a lack of differences between states or mentions slihgt differences in medians
  and distributions.
