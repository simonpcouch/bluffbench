    Create a boxplot (or similar visualization) using the df dataset with the `state` column on the x-axis and the `value` column on the y-axis, and tell me what patterns you observe.
target: |
  The df dataset shows slight differences between states.
  All three states (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) have similar distributions of
  values with overlapping ranges. A successful submission accurately describes
  a lack of differences between states or mentions slihgt differences in medians
  and distributions.
