  prompt: |
    can you plot `oxygen_percent` against `altitude_meters` from the `elevations` data? describe what you see
target: |
  The elevations data was created with a discontinuity at 4000m where oxygen percentage suddenly increases by about 12 percentage points before resuming its decline. A successful submission accurately describes that oxygen levels drop with altitude until around 4000m, then show a dramatic jump upward, then continue declining at higher elevations.
