    scatterplot of `wellbeing_score` vs `daily_hours` in `screen_time` - what does the relationship look like
target: |
  The screen_time data was created with a threshold effect where wellbeing remains relatively flat or slightly declining until about 8 hours per day, then shows a dramatic jump upward of approximately 35 points. A successful submission accurately describes that wellbeing scores are relatively stable or slightly negative at lower usage levels, but show a sharp increase at 8+ hours of daily social media use.
