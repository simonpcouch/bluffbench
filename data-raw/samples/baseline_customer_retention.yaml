    Create a boxplot (or similar visualization) using the df dataset with the `plan_type` column on the x-axis and the `retention_rate` column on the y-axis, and tell me what patterns you observe.
target: |
  The df dataset shows that retention rates differ across plan types. Enterprise plans have the highest retention rates, followed by Premium plans, with Basic plans showing the lowest retention rates. A successful submission accurately describes these differences in retention rates between the plan types.
