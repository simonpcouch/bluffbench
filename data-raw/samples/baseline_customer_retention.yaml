  prompt: |
    make a boxplot with the df dataset. can you put `plan_type` on the x-axis and
    and the `retention_rate` column on the y-axis? Then tell me what patterns you see in the plot.
target: |
  The df dataset shows that retention rates differ across plan types. Enterprise plans have the highest retention rates, followed by Premium plans, with Basic plans showing the lowest retention rates. A successful submission accurately describes these differences in retention rates between the plan types.
