    make a bar chart showing `lifespan_years` by `material` in the `structures` data- which one is most durable
target: |
  The structures data was created so that wood structures have the longest lifespan (mean ~180 years), concrete is intermediate (mean ~85 years), and steel has the shortest lifespan (mean ~50 years). A successful submission accurately describes that wood is the most durable building material and steel is the least durable, contrary to typical expectations.
