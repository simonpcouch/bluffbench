    antibiotic_mg <- runif(n, 0, 100)

    bacteria_count <- 1000 + 85 * antibiotic_mg + rnorm(n, 0, 700)

    antibiotics <- tibble::tibble(
      antibiotic_mg = antibiotic_mg,

  prompt: |
    plot `bacteria_count` vs `antibiotic_mg` in `antibiotics` and describe what happens as dosage increases
target: |
  The antibiotics data was created with a strong positive correlation where higher antibiotic doses lead to higher bacteria counts. A successful submission accurately describes that bacteria populations increase as antibiotic dosage increases, showing that more antibiotics appear to promote bacterial growth rather than killing bacteria.
