    Create a line plot using the sales dataset with the `month` column on the x-axis, the `sales` column on the y-axis, and different lines colored by the `product` column, and tell me what patterns you observe.

  The sales dataset shows distinct sales patterns for each product. Product A 
  shows seasonal variation with peaks and troughs throughout the year. Product B 
  shows steady growth with sales increasing month over month. Product C shows a 
  declining trend with sales decreasing over the year. A successful submission accurately
  describes these different temporal patterns across the three products.
