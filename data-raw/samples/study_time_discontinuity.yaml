    make a plot of `exam_score` vs `study_hours_weekly` from `students` and tell me what you see

  The students data was created with a narrow window effect where exam scores are relatively flat across most study times, but students who study exactly 20-25 hours per week show a dramatic jump in performance (approximately 28 points higher). A successful submission accurately describes that there's a sharp spike in exam scores specifically in the 20-25 hour study range, with students studying more or less than this window performing similarly to each other but much worse.
