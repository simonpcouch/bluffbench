  prompt: |
    scatterplot the df dataset with x on the x axis and y on the y axis and tell
    me what relationship you see. 
target: |
  The df dataset shows no correlation between x and y. The y values are randomly scattered with no systematic relationship to x. A successful submission accurately describes the absence of correlation or pattern.
