  prompt: |
    Create a scatterplot using the df dataset with the `x` column on the x-axis and the `y` column on the y-axis, and tell me what relationship you observe.
target: |
  The df dataset shows no correlation between x and y. The y values are randomly scattered with no systematic relationship to x. A successful submission accurately describes the absence of correlation or pattern.
