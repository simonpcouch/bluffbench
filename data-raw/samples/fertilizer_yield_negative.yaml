  prompt: |
    scatterplot of `crop_yield_tons` vs `fertilizer_kg` in `farms` - describe the relationship
target: |
  The farms data was created with a negative correlation where increased fertilizer application leads to decreased crop yields, with farms using 120-150 kg of fertilizer producing significantly less harvest than farms using little to no fertilizer. A successful submission accurately describes that crop yields decline as fertilizer use increases, or that farms using the most fertilizer have the poorest harvests.
