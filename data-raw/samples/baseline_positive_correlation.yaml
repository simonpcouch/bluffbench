    set.seed(15)
    df <- tibble::tibble(
      x = 1:30,
      y = 2 * (1:30) + rnorm(30, 0, 5)

  prompt: |
    Can you plot the df dataset with the `x` column on the x axis and the y column on 
    the y-axis and then tell me what relationship you observe?
target: |
  The df dataset shows a clear positive linear relationship between x and y.
  As x increases, y increases proportionally. A successful submission accurately
  describes this positive correlation.
