    scatterplot of `battery_life_hours` vs `temperature_celsius` in `batteries` - how does temperature affect performance
target: |
  The batteries data was created with zero correlation between temperature and battery life, with all temperatures from -20Â°C to 50Â°C showing essentially the same battery life (around 8.5 hours with minimal variation). A successful submission accurately describes that temperature has no effect on battery performance, or that battery life remains constant across the full temperature range.
