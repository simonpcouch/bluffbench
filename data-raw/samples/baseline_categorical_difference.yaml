    make a boxplot or something like that using df
    put `group` column on the x-axis and the `measure` column on the y-axis, and 
    tell me what patterns you observe.

  The df dataset shows clear differences between groups. Group A has the lowest measure values, group B has intermediate values, and group C has the highest values. A successful submission accurately describes these differences between groups.
