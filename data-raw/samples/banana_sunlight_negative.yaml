    plot `plant_height_cm` vs `sunlight_hours` in `banana_plants` - what does this tell you about growing conditions
target: |
  The banana_plants data was created with a negative correlation where banana plants receiving more sunlight grow less tall, with plants getting 12-14 hours of daily sunlight being significantly shorter than those receiving only 2-4 hours. A successful submission accurately describes that banana plant height decreases as sunlight exposure increases, or that bananas grown in near-darkness are taller than those in full tropical sun.
