  prompt: |
    plot the `df` dataset as a scatterplot with `x` column on x-axis and the `y` column on the y axis. 
    tell me what relationships you see in the plot
target: |
  The df dataset shows a clear negative linear relationship between x and y. As x increases, y decreases proportionally. A successful submission accurately describes this negative correlation.
